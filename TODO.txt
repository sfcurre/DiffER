Priority:
    1. Separate diffusion calculations from model and sampling loop [DONE, CHECK]
    2. Transition to config-file based system (command line is getting messy) [DONE, CHECK]
    3. Implement continuous-time diffusion model

Secondary:
    2. Remove unused parameters from code (leftovers from previous tests, etc.)

Paper-related TODOs:
    1. ask about funding info
